Apollon Core 0.13.6.x
=====================

Setup
---------------------
[Apollon Core] (https://apollonchain.org/get-apollon/) is the original Apollon client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Apollon transactions (which is currently several hundreds MBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Apollon on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/apollon-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/apollond` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run apollon-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Apollon-Core to your applications folder, and then run Apollon-Core.
